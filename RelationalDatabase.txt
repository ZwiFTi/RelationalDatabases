  select food from diet where species = 'orangutan'
  
  select = Wer're fetching data out of the database rather than inserting
  food = a column
  from = what table we are talking about (diet)
  where species = 'orangutan' = This is a restriction, it says what rows we want. We want the rows where species = orangutan
  
  We fetch data from a database by writing a code that sends a query to the database and the database responds with sending a new table to us!
